# Teaching and Supervision
## Supervision


### Current Students
- **Taylor Woodward** (PhD Candidate)
- **Yujing Liu** (PhD Candidate)

### Research Associates
- **Tom Cummings**
- **Yang Zhao**

  Co-mentored research associates on the project *Clone wars: predicting clonal diversity in resistance to CAR-T cell immunotherapy*

### Past Students
- **Dr. Megan Coomer** (2019-2023)  

  Co-supervised to completion (with Prof Michael P.H. Stumpf). Megan is now co-founder of the venture capital-backed deep tech company [Cell Bauhaus](https://cellbauhaus.com).


## Current Teaching 

**Mathematics and Statistics for Biomedicine (MAST10024)**  
*Semester 1, 2025 - The University of Melbourne*

I coordinate and lecture this large service subject for biomedicine students. The course covers mechanistic modeling (ODEs and mass-action kinetics), epidemics (compartmental models), and statistical/data analysis techniques (hypothesis testing and linear regression).

## Recent Workshops

**The Fundamentals of Whole Cell Modelling: Stochastic Simulation in Julia**  
*AMSI BioInfoSummer Workshop, 2024 - The University of Melbourne*

In conjunction with Dr. Kaan Öcal and Dr. Augustinas Šukys, developed and delivered interactive materials on stochastic modelling of biochemical systems using the Julia programming language, introducing participants to practical implementation of stochastic algorithms for cellular simulations.

## Previous Teaching Experience

**Thinking Scientifically (SCIE20001)**  
*2023 - The University of Melbourne*

I managed student queries for the data science module serving over 800 students on the Ed Discussion platform, and led the overhaul of learning exercises, Minitab worksheets, and datasets.

**Tutor and Mathematics Support**  
*2013-2018 - La Trobe University*
